      summary: Transform image
      description: |
        Transform an image to match a song's visual aesthetic using a three-stage pipeline:
        1. Lookup/fetch visual aesthetic for the song (cached in SQLite)
        2. GPT-4o generates a Flux.2 prompt using aesthetic + image context
        3. Flux.2 Klein 9B executes the image transformation
